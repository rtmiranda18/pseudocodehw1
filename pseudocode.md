Prompt 1: Create a function `calculateSum` that takes in an array of integers. 
Your function returns the sum of all integers within the input array.

Pseudocode: 

    Step One:

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Create a variable sum with a value of 0. 

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the keyword var, add equal sign and the value, 0. 

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: Do this in order to have a baseline number for a sum. 

    Step Two: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Iterate the array

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use a for loop

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: In order to analyze every element in the function

    Step Three: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Add the current element with the previous element

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the total number function where in you add the elements

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: In order to gradually add up the numbers as you go along the function

    Step Four: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Return the value of sum

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the return function

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: To return the output which is the sum of the array.


Prompt 2: Create a function `mean` that takes in an array of integers as an argument. Your function returns the `mean` / `average` for all integers within the input array.

Pseudocode: 

    Step One:

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Create a variable mean with a value of 0. 

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the keyword var, add equal sign and the value, 0. 

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: In order to have a baseline mean to compare to. 

    Step Two: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Divide the sum by the number of variable in the array

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the sum function from the previous example and divide it with the array using the length element. 

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: In order to calculate the mean

    Step Three: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Return the answer

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the return function

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: In order to get the mean of integers in the array


Prompt 3: Create a function `median` that takes in an array of integers as an argument. Your function returns the median of your input array.

    Step One:

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Create a  median function 

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: By making a function called median with values in the parentheses

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: In order to get the median, you need to know the middle variable in the array.

    Step Two: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Create a sort function

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the function method and input the values of the array

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: To be able to get the values of the array in order to discover the median.

    Step Three: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Compare the outcome of the sort function to the median function

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the if else statement

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: To be able to see what the median is by comparison

    Step Four: 

    Q: What are you going to do? 

    A: Return the answer

    Q: How are you going to do it? 

    A: Use the return function

    Q: Why are you going to do it? 

    A: To be able to get the output which is the median of integers in the array.
